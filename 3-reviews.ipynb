The top 22 percent of your one star reviews include the terms \"worst\" and \"rude\" among other non-descriptive terms. These are the most common words in those one star reviews, but the following 22 percent include references to a \"she\" or \"lady\" at the \"front desk\" who \"checked\"(them in). The next highest frequency terms, at 13 percent of the reviews include the terms \"check\", \"arrived\", \"checked\", \"greeted\", and \"front desk\" again. These all paint the picture that the reception area should be your primary area of improvement as this is where the majority of your negative reviews are coming from. \n",
